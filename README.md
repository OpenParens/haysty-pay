# farmers-market-pay
Due to concerns around the coronavirus pandemic the format of our local farmers market has changed. Previously vendors were set up at tables so that customers could freely walk around from vendor to vendor. Now, the vendors are lined up in a parking lot and the customers drive through visiting each vendor one at a time. This works really well for keeping a safe distance between people but slows down the process quite a bit.

The goal of this project will be to provide an application that simplifies in person payments to reduce congestion. Each vendor will add the total for a customer to an invoice for that customer. Payment will be taken at the end by a farmers market representative, not an individual vendor. This will reduce the amount of time a customer needs to spend at each vendor. During busy times, more stations could be set up to take multiple payments at the same time. The rate of customers through the vendors will be determined by the slowest vendor at any give point. By allowing multiple customers to pay at the end, each vendor's process is simplified and should allow for faster throughput.
